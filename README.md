# Miku Cursor Theme
This is a cursor theme port from Windows version, containing cute miku animation.

I don't know where is the source, just founded from [here](https://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=1760192).

Some icons are copied from Breeze cursor theme, one of the default KDE cursor theme.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmeletWithoutEgg/miku-cursor-theme.git
cp miku-cursor-theme ~/.icons/ -r
```
