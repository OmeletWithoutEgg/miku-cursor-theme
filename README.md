# Miku Cursor Theme
This is a cursor theme port from Windows version, containing cute miku animation.

Used tools and references:
- I don't know where is the source of `.ani` and `.cur`, just founded from [here](https://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=1760192).
- [cursor-converter](https://github.com/paddygord/cursor-converter/blob/master/convert.sh)
- [Fixed text icon](https://tech.toryanderson.com/2020/03/08/building-custom-x11-cursors-for-linux/)
- Some icons are copied from [Breeze cursor theme](https://store.kde.org/p/999991/), one of the default KDE cursor theme.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmeletWithoutEgg/miku-cursor-theme.git
cp miku-cursor-theme ~/.icons/ -r
```
or put it into the path your desktop environment uses.
